1. "Concise Object Methods" allow you to drop the ": function" part of a method.
var actions = {
  sayName: function () {  alert(this.name)},
  takeStep: function () {  this.step++}
}

now:
var actions = {
  sayName () {    alert(this.name)  },
  takeStep () {    this.step++  }
}

2. Arrow functions
  - Purpose: more concise syntax and sharing lexical "this" with the parent scope.
    + arrow functions don't create a new context -> preserve the previous context of this
