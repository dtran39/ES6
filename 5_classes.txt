1. Instead of  using createClass. Instead, we're creating a class that extends React.Component.
2. Constructor function:
  - Replace getInitialState
  - before you set anything to the instance
    you need to call super() which calls the constructor function of the thing we're extending,
      in this case React.component.
3.  no longer have commas between our properties since we're not in an object anymore.
4.  PropTypes are moved out of the class and added afterwards,
      just like we're used to doing with Stateless Functional Components
5. When we use createClass,
    the 'this' keyword is autobound for us.
  Meaning, we don't have to worry about
    which context the function using 'this' will be called in
    since it will always be bound to the original context.
  This isn't the case for classes.
    We can use .bind
      to fix this problem when we're passing in a function to another component (context)
      or we can use our handy dandy arrow functions as we did passing updateItems to onFormSubmit.
